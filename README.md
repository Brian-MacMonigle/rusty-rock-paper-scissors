# rusty-rock-paper-scissors

Practicing Rust:
https://www.rust-lang.org/

The goal of this program was to practice the simple syntax with a fun game of (Rusty) Rock Paper Scissors.
Special care was taken for Error Handling, and edge cases from input, to practice Rust's compiler first thoroughness.

This is my first Rust program, be gentle.
